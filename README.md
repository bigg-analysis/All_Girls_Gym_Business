College. Other subsets of markets will include recently graduated college students and young
professionals. All market segments being targeted are physically active, have some form of
social media with a network of at least 50 women, and have moderate disposable income.
There will be multiple communication avenues in order to market Girls Girls Girls Health
and Wellness Center, but the central message will stay the same: Girls Girls Girls is a wellness
center that emphasizes the community and empowerment of women through exercise and
recreation. It also houses equipment and facilities tailored for women, giving our members a
better experience overall. Our goal is to be inviting to women who are looking to better

The marketing strategies of Girls Girls Girls Health and Wellness Center will mostly be
electronically sent to our target market. The main avenues of communication include social
media, text, and email. As for physical marketing, we will advertise with billboards and flyers
around the city of Tallahassee. Internal marketing for our current members will also occur by
utilizing an app and a website. This allows for members to stay up to date with any events or
promotions that we may offer.
The total marketing budget will be $24,010. The budget mainly accounts for the different
mediums that we will be utilizing in order to communicate with our members and visitors, with
the website/app and billboard signage costing almost two-thirds of the budget. This budget was
created by researching different marketing mediums and how much they would cost monthly.
Compared to our revenues, the budget of the marketing plan would only cost 8.6% of projected
revenues. This plan will be effective in creating the revenue goals that are needed for success of
this wellness center.
